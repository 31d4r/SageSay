# Project Title: SageSay

The initial spark for SageSay took root during the unusual circumstances of the COVID-19 quarantine. During this time of global uncertainty and personal unpredictability, I found comfort in creation. As a diligent student and an aspiring developer, crafting this application proved to be both a welcomed distraction and an opportunity for skill enhancement.

Originally developed within the span of 20 minutes, SageSay began as a quick mood-lifter project that also served as a much-needed update to my GitHub repository. The core function of the app is to generate inspirational quotes randomly with each launch, providing little moments of wisdom and motivation at a simple click.

Fast forward to today, SageSay has grown and evolved tremendously from its humble beginnings. In response to learning new skills and receiving valuable feedback, I've implemented significant updates to improve the user experience and overall performance:

- Transitioned to a programmatic UI creation with UIKit, which allows for a cleaner, more efficient, and maintainable codebase.
- Developed a fully customizable notification system. Users now have the autonomy to set their preferred time and select their notification sound, enabling them to receive their daily dose of inspiration precisely when they need it.
- Adopted an efficient ViewModel in the app's architecture for a more robust handling of API data and overall improvement of the MVC structure.
Looking ahead, I am excited to explore the intricacies of algorithms and plan to incorporate Swift algorithms in my forthcoming updates to the GitHub repository.

I invite you to join me in this journey of continuous learning and improvement. Your support, feedback, and constructive criticism are always welcome and appreciated. To get a glimpse of SageSay's latest look, feel free to check out the screenshots below!
